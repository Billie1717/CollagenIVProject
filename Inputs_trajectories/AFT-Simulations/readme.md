# The simulations giving rise to AFT data

The simulations for the AFT data were run using more molecules and with 4 conditions: 

1. No bond breaking + stretching
2. Bond breaking + stretching 
3. Bond breaking + no stretching
4. 7s perturbed networks, bond breaking + stretching

This folder contains the instructions and information about those 4 conditions. The first 3 are found in folder 'Wild_Type' and the 4th in 7S_perturbed
It also contains informations about the analysis of these simulations (creating mimick 'microscopy' images, and then applying the AFT-alignment image analysis tool)
