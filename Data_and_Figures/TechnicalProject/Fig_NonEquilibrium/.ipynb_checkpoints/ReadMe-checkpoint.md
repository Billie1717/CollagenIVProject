This data is produced in the remote directory:
Scratch/Collagen/model_strict_tetramer/NonEquilibriumSeededWorkflow/Plotting/AlignmentAndFitting.ipynb

Where many mol-alignment files are analysed. (See folder /Relaxation for how mol-alignment curves are acquired)

The NonEquilibrium.ipynb also has plotting of the strain relation between phi0 and phi_inf for both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes
